			I am twenty seven years old commuting from the east bay and I am an electrical engineer graduating from SFSU fall 2013. My interests are generally in computers and the components inside them. Working on this project gave me a better appreciation of programmers and more knowledge of the language C++. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in electronics.

			Once of the time at night, when I stand on top of Berkeley hill, looking down from the top to the bay area, roads on ground were like the electrical wires, cars were similar to the electrons moving, and buildings were like the resistors, capacitors and inductors. At that moment, I had decide to be an electrical engineer. I had been studying electric engineering in SFSU since 2010. After couple years of suffering, I decided to join the final senior project, the group of 3D music design group. As the whole year went by, the project named, T3MPO, which it is the best project I had been work together. I have learn many coding which I used to work on; however, never expect to be excited. Because of the boring stage in coding in C++, I thought I will never want to look in to that a lot. After the process of creating T3MPO with teams, coding with good results which make me feel happy and exciting. That brings my curious of creating something new from coding. With the limited resource, we had been greatly achieve to what we had expect to be done, 3D music controller, T3MPO.For 2014, I am grad to graduating from SFSU and getting my BS degree for electrical engineering. For future days, I am willing to look forward to job in the field of what I had learn in school; especially, power system is another interesting me as working on. I will hopefully getting some more knowledge and working process on the saving energy as my future goal
