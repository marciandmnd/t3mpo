<h3>VIII. Discussion & Conclusion</h3>

<p>
	The T3MPO project offers an exploration into alternative means of electronic music production using 3D sensors.  The primary objective of T3MPO, toggling audio clips via a button grid, was satisfied.  Furthermore, since the primary objective was satisfied with a fair amount of time remaining in the term, additional T3MPO modules were implemented.  These additonal modules were scatcher, guitar, and Synapse modes.  Also, a standalone T3MPO application with an internal audio engine was realized that enables users to toggle loops and trigger sounds.

	Naturally, improvements to the system can be made.  The architecture of the T3MPO modules, as it stands, is quite procedural as opposed to object-oriented. This means that features of the T3MPO software were implemented using primitive data types and structures such as integer arrays. Object oriented programming (OOP), on the other hand, is an incredibly powerful approach to software development. In OOP, everything is an object. An object encapsulates, or provides a higher level of abstraction, of behavior and states of particular software elements.  With respect to T3MPO, this means that modules and their respective elements can be instantiated as class objects.  For instance the button grid can be a class object as well as the buttons themselves. If T3MPO is to be developed further, an object-oriented approach would serve the system and its developers well. By using an OOP approach, a T3MPO application programming interface (API) may be written to provide developers with a powerful toolset for writing T3MPO modules
