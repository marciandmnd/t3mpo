<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<br>
<p>
	The primary objective of T3MPO was to develop a software interface that provides users the capability to control the playback of audio clips in Ableton, a popular digital audio workstation(DAW), in 3-dimensional space. To control clip playback, a 5 x 5 button grid was superimposed on a depth-map image of the user.  The user can toggle the virtual buttons on or off in a similar fashion to their analog counterparts.  That is, to toggle a virtual button, a user pushes it.

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<br>
	<strong>Hardware Constraints:</strong>
	<br><br>
	<p>
	<em>Kinect Sensor and Computer</em>:  
	The Kinect is the 3D sensor used by T3MPO to retrieve and delineate the user's body position and gesture data. A desktop or laptop computer is also required to run T3MPO.
	<br><br>
	The following hardware is required to use T3MPO:
	<div style="padding-left:10px;">
	<ul>
		<li>Microsoft OS: Windows XP, 8Vista, 7, or </li>
		<li>Apple OS: MAC OS X 10.6 or later</li>
		<li>32 bit (x86) or 64 bit (x64) processor</li>
		<li>Dual-core 2.66-GHz or faster processor</li>
		<li>Dedicated USB 2.0 bus</li>
		<li>2 GB RAM</li> 
	</ul> 
	</div>
	<br>
	</p>
	<strong>Software Constraints:</strong>
	<br><br>
	<p>
	A number of software libraries and products from 3rd parties are required for developing and using T3MPO.
	<br><br>
	The following software is required to use T3MPO:
	<div style="padding-left:10px;">
	<ul>
		<li>OpenNI: Open source software development kit for 3D Sensors.</li>
		<li>Synapse: A software module built using OpenNI framework and has message sending capabilities for communication with DAWs.</li>
		<li>Ableton: Ableton is the DAW whose state parameters are modulated via T3MPO. The system requirements for Ableton are: IntelÂ® Mac with Mac OS X 10.5 or later, or PC with Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8; Multicore processor; 2 GB RAM; 1024x768 display; DVD drive or broadband internet connection for installation;  3GB free disk space are required for basic installation</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The primary design constraint of T3MPO was to program a 5x5, transparent button grid for the T3MPO user interface. This button grid is superimposed upon the depth map of the user and provides visual feedback with regards to which audio clips are currently playing or stopped and also issues commands to the Live environment. 

	Created to emulate the functionality of a traditional MIDI programmable controller (MPC), each of the four leftmost columns of buttons represents audio or MIDI clips associated with a specific track or instrument in Ableton Live.  The user can command Live to start or stop playing a clip by moving their hand within the horizontal and vertical (x, y) limits of a button and then quickly moving their hand forward (z).  Buttons light up to inform the user that the corresponding clip is currently being looped in the Live environment.  Clips can be triggered individually to make gradual changes to a song, or the user can access the fifth column of buttons that will control the playback of all of the clips of the corresponding row (scene).

	<br>
	When an audio clip is off, the respective button is gray. Next, when a user toggles a button on, the button color changes to yellow and vise-versa. When a scene is launched, or turned on, the corresponding scene control button in the fifth column changes color from gray (the off state) to magenta (the on state).

	To allow users to stop all audio playback at once, a global stop button was added to the upper-left corner of the user interface. This stop button is red and about 50% transparent. When the stop button is activated by the user, its opacity briefly goes to 100%, thus providing the user with feedback that the stop command has been acknowledged.

	We need to determine a forward motion (press) occurred by sampling and comparing two frames worth of depth (z) position data for the right and left hands.  If the newest z-position exceeds the previous by a certain distance threshold, we decide that the user had moved their hand in a deliberate way to press a button.

	Further algorithms are necessary to update the graphics for the 5x5 grid to match the behavior of clip playback in the Live environment.  For example, tracks in Ableton Live can only play one clip associated with that given track at a time, so we must program the grid to correctly inform the user of this behavior.
