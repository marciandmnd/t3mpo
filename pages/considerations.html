<h3>VI. Design Considerations</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<br>
<p>The primary objective of T3MPO was to develop a software interface that provides users the capability to control the playback of audio clips in Ableton, a popular digital audio workstation(DAW), in 3-dimensional space. To control clip playback, a 5 x 5 button grid was superimposed on a depth-map image of the user.  The user can toggle the virtual buttons on or off in a similar fashion to their analog counterparts.  That is, to toggle a virtual button, a user pushes it.

	</ul> 
	<br><strong>Software Constraints:</strong><br><br>

	<u>OpenNI</u>: Open source software development kit for 3D Sensors.<br>
	<u>Synapse</u>: A software module built using OpenNI framework and has message sending capabilities for communication with DAWs.<br>
