	The primary design objectives of T3MPO were satisfied.  Users of T3MPO may toggle playback of audio clips in Ableton via a button-grid in 3D space.  Furthermore, since the primary objectives were completed in a timely fashion, other T3MPO modules were programmed that allow further manipulation of the DAW.  Also, a standalone T3MPO application was realized successfully.

	<strong>T3MPO Primary Design Results</strong><br><br>
	<p>
	The T3MPO project proved to be a great success as a tool in performing electronic music.  It supplemented Synapse with additional means of controlling the musical environment while still reducing the number of tasks to be performed by the user’s CPU.  Furthermore, T3MPO’s GUIs allow performers and their audience to experience the performance with a level of visual feedback that previously has not been available to concertgoers.

In MPC mode, graphics inform spectators of transitions within the musical structure of the song and allow a performer to more easily make those transitions.  The creation of a single dedicated Max for Live module to handle the communication exported by MPC mode greatly simplifies the original means of clip playback in Synapse while still allowing the playback control of twenty unique clips.  However, traditional MPCs used by electronic performers can sometimes control the playback of ten to twenty times as many clips.  With that in mind, future versions of T3MPO will include simple methods to control many more clips to match the true functionality of MPC and other MIDI controllers.

Scratcher mode supplements Synapse with completely original quantization and rhythm controls.  The scratching and stuttering effects produced in this mode delight both the performer and audience alike.  However, the playback control of only four audio clips leaves something to be desired.  Future versions of T3MPO will look to handle a larger number of clips and will alter the use model to make quantization and rhythm controls more intuitive and seamless.

T3MPO’s guitar mode was developed as an exploration of concepts in MIDI programming and music theory.  We really wanted to toy with the creation of virtual instruments and explore alternative means of performing electronic music.  We thought the virtual guitar would be a visually interesting concept to explore and are mostly happy with its capabilities.  However, as the guitar is a six-stringed instrument that is capable of playing many notes together or separately, we are disappointed with the simplicity of the model that we developed.  In the future we would like to examine this mode more deeply in order to create a more expressive, virtual MIDI instrument capable of honoring the guitar.
</p>
<p>
In the end, we believe that we have created an application that is capable of really changing the way that we play and witness music performances.  While further development is necessary to polish T3MPO, we are confident that electronic performers and their audience will enjoy our application and see it as an improvement to the traditional concert experience.

<strong>T3MPO Alternative Design Results</strong>
	<br><br>
	<p>
	The standalone T3MPO application was implemented with success.  In this application, a user's hands are tracked using OpenNI's hand tracking algorithm. Tracked hands are capable of toggling audio loops and triggering sound clips. XAudio2 provides the capability for simultaneous sound playback, so users are able to play multiple sounds and loops at the same time!
	</p>
	<p>
	The standalone application, at its current stage of its development, has very limited DAW functionality when compared to Ableton Live.  The only DAW functionality implemented by the standalone is loop playback and sound triggering.  Other DAW features, such as sound libraries, audio effects, and recording would be awesome features to implement in future versions of the standalone application.
	</p>
	<p>
	The main shortcoming of the standalone application is that users lack the ability to customize their T3MPO session.  For instance, all sounds in the program have to be hardcoded directly into the source code.  Once a program is compiled, users are stuck with the sound files referenced by the source code.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Furthermore, while the application is capable of playing multiple sounds simultaneously, it isn't able to play individual sounds assigned to a particular button at the same time.  In other words, a unique sound cannot be re-triggered until it has finished playing.
	</p>
	<p>
	The standalone application, though it has much room for improvement, may be used by electronic music performers to supplement their sets and give their audience a new type of experience.  Compared to a traditional MPC performance, the standalone application is able to similarly play programmed sounds. The MPC is a robust production tool and the standalone application lacks many MPC features such as note repeating, pitch shifting, tempo and quantization settings, and recording.  To implement these features as a standalone feature of T3MPO is desirable, but would require much time and resources.
