	The primary design objectives of T3MPO were satisfied.  Users of T3MPO may toggle playback of audio clips in Ableton via a button-grid in 3D space.  Furthermore, since the primary objectives were completed in a timely fashion, other T3MPO modules were programmed that allow further manipulation of the DAW.  Also, a standalone T3MPO application was realized successfully.
