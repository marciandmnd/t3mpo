<h3>VII. Results</h3>
<hr>
	The primary design objectives of T3MPO were satisfied.  Users of T3MPO may toggle playback of audio clips in Ableton via a button-grid in 3D space.  Furthermore, since the primary objectives were completed in a timely fashion, other T3MPO modules were programmed that allow further manipulation of the DAW.  Also, a standalone T3MPO application was realized successfully.

	<p>
	A standalone T3MPO application was implemented with success.  In this application, a user's hands are tracked using OpenNI's handtracking algorithm. Once the hands are tracked, quadrants are superimposed on the depth map rendered by OpenNi using Kinect sensor data. The architecture of the program was written such that a user's left hand toggles loop playback, while the right hand triggers sounds. To toggle a loop or trigger a sound, a user's hand must enter a quadrant and 'slap' it.  Each quadrant is assigned a loop and a sound.  The program knows what hand is used to slap the quadrant and is able to toggle a loop or trigger a sound accordingly. Audio loop and sound files are hardcoded directly into the source code. The application uses XAudio2, a low-level audio API, to handle sound playback and mixing.  XAudio2 provides the capability for simultaneous sound playback, so users are able to play multiple sounds and loops at the same time!
