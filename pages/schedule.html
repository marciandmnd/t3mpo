<h4>Schedule</h4>
<br>
<p>
	The development of T3MPO was a two semester, or academic year, long project.  In the first term, Spring 2013, our design project was selected and researched. The necessary hardware and software stacks were investigated and the development environment was setup on each team member's computer. In the second term, Fall 2013, the implementation of T3MPO was undertaken under the guidance of our faculty advisor, Dr. Tom Holton. The schedule is summarized in the table below:

<h4>Budget</h4>
<br>
<p>
	To develop T3MPO, the necessary hardware and software had to be acquired.  Our team actually had all the resources required prior to development and did not have to spend much money.  However, if no resources were available prior to development, the monetary costs incurred would have been as follows:

<strong>Table 2.</strong> Breakdown of costs to develop T3MPO from scratch
</div>
<br>
<p>
	The table above summarizes the costs to develop T3MPO if the resources had to be gathered from scratch.  However, our team already had much of the resources already gathered.  Everyone on the team had a computer. A team member was already in possession of a Kinect sensor, and we were able to borrow other Kinect sensors from associates.  A couple team members are involved with music production and already had Ableton software installed on their machines.  Thus the actual cost for our team develop T3MPO was just $40! This cost is simply because a team-member invested in a used Kinect sensor.  Otherwise, the direct costs were $0!
