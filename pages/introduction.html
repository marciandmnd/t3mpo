<strong>The Problem</strong>

<br><br>
<p>
The genre of electronic music is constantly expanding. In recent years, the genre has become “a stadium-level moneymaker.” Electronic dance music festivals like the Electric Daisy Carnival today sell out hundreds of thousands tickets in advance. Even traditionally rock-and-roll festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza now feature headlining electronic music acts. In order to compose and perform music, popular electronic artists frequently rely on a combination of software-based digital audio workstations (DAWs) to customize sounds, construct songs, and process samples as well as MIDI-programmable controllers to trigger musical transitions and events, control the parameters or effects of a synthesizer, and play melodies for an assigned instrument.

As an unfortunate consequence of the performer’s reliance on electronic-based production equipment, the performer is limited to turning knobs and dials, flipping switches or pushing buttons to create music. We believe that this form of performance is particularly lacking from the standpoint of the audience and fails to capture the true potential of the human body.

<strong>The Solution</strong>

<p>
The Touchless 3D Music Production Overlord (T3MPO) is a system that eliminates the use of the MPC and effectively turns the performer’s body into a musical instrument. The DAW user can compose music and tweak parameters by moving their body and interacting with virtual instruments and controls in 3D space. T3MPO also features the creation of real-time, musical graphics that will help aid and inform the audience during the performance.
