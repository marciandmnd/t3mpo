<strong>The Problem</strong>

<br><br>

The genre of electronic music is constantly expanding. In recent years, the genre has become “a stadium-level moneymaker.” Electronic dance music festivals like the Electric Daisy Carnival today sell out hundreds of thousands tickets in advance. Even traditionally rock-and-roll festivals like Coachella and Lollapalooza now feature headlining electronic music acts. In order to compose and perform music, popular electronic artists frequently rely on a combination of software-based digital audio workstations (DAWs) to customize sounds, construct songs, and process samples as well as MIDI-programmable controllers to trigger musical transitions and events, control the parameters or effects of a synthesizer, and play melodies for an assigned instrument.

As an unfortunate consequence of the performer’s reliance on electronic-based production equipment, the performer is limited to turning knobs and dials, flipping switches or pushing buttons to create music. We believe that this form of performance is particularly lacking from the standpoint of the audience. The Touchless 3D Music Production Overlord (T3MPO) is a system that eliminates the use of physical components to create music in a DAW. Rather, the user of the DAW composes music via body gestures and movements in 3-dimensional space. Body gesture/movement data are captured by infrared and RGB camera sensors in the Microsoft Kinect. The data is then used as control inputs to tweak parameters and trigger events in the DAW, effectively turning the human body into a musical instrument. Furthermore, the system will also feature the creation of real-time, musical visualizations that will help aid the audience’s experience. This system improves upon the already popular genre of electronic music.

<strong>The Solution</strong>
<br><br>

The Touchless 3-Dimensional Music Production Overlord (T3MPO) is an OSX/Windows application that allows users to produce and perform music by moving their body and interacting with a virtual set of controls.  T3MPO adds additional functionality to Ryan Challinor’s application, Synapse, which sends the position and event data of fifteen joints of the body measured by Microsoft’s Kinect to be processed by a digital audio workstation, Ableton Live.  T3MPO has a total of four modes of operation for assembling the structures of songs, creating complex rhythms, generating MIDI notes, and tweaking effects and settings on the fly.  T3MPO’s graphical user interfaces (GUIs) additionally inform the audience to better understand how electronic artists play music during a performance.
