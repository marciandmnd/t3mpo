The Touchless 3-Dimensional Music Production Overlord (T3MPO) is an OSX/Windows application that allows users to produce and perform music by moving their body and interacting with a virtual set of controls.  T3MPO adds additional functionality to Ryan Challinor’s application, Synapse, which sends the position and event data of fifteen joints of the body measured by Microsoft’s Kinect to be processed by a digital audio workstation, Ableton Live.  T3MPO has a total of four modes of operation for assembling the structures of songs, creating complex rhythms, generating MIDI notes, and tweaking effects and settings on the fly.  T3MPO’s graphical user interfaces (GUIs) additionally inform the audience to better understand how electronic artists play music during a performance.

Prior to the completion of T3MPO, a standalone alternative was first developed as a backup in case the original goals of the project could not be realized using the frameworks and preexisting applications previously described.  This alternative version uses an internal audio engine to facilitate audio loop toggling and sound triggering.
