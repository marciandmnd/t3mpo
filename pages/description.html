	The T3MPO project was developed to allow music performance and production to occur in 3D space.  T3MPO was developed in two tiers.  The first, or primary tier, gives users the ability to control parameters of Ableton, a powerful and popular DAW.  Multiple T3MPO modules were engineered to facilitate functions such as audio clip and scene launching, clip 'scratching', and guitar playing. The second, or alternative, tier was engineered as a backup in case the primary tier couldn't be realized.  This alternative tier of T3MPO uses an internal audio engine to facilitate audio loop toggling and sound triggering.
