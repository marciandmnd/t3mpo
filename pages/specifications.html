<h3>V. Design Specs, Alternatives, & Implementation</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Design Requirements</h4>
<p>
T3MPO must accurately represent the playback status of the audio clips in the Ableton environment.  That is, visual feedback must be provided to the user such that they know which clips are being played and which are stopped.  Multiple buttons can be pressed simulataneously.  
<br><br>
<strong>MPC Mode</strong>
<br><br>
The starting mode of T3MPO acts as an environment where the main structure of the song can be assembled.

Created to emulate the functionality of a traditional MIDI programmable controller (MPC), MPC mode features a 5x5, transparent grid of buttons drawn on the center of the screen.  Each of the four leftmost columns of buttons represents audio or MIDI clips associated with a specific track in Ableton Live. The user can command Live to start or stop playing a clip by moving their hand within the horizontal and vertical (x, y) limits of a button and then quickly moving their hand forward (z).  Buttons light up to inform the user that the corresponding clip is currently being looped in the Live environment.  Clips can be triggered individually to make gradual changes to a song, or the user can access the fifth column of buttons that will control the playback of all of the clips of the corresponding row.

We determined that a forward motion (press) occurred by sampling and comparing two frames worth of depth (z) position data for the right and left hands.  If the newest z-position exceeded the previous by a certain distance threshold, we decided that user had moved their hand in a deliberate way to press a button.

Further algorithms were developed to update the graphics for the 5x5 grid to match the behavior of clip playback in the Live environment.  For example, tracks in Ableton Live can only play one clip associated with that given track at a time, so we programmed the grid to correctly inform the user of this behavior.

Previously, Synapse allowed for clip launching through the combined use of the Clip Launcher and Max Kinect Event modules.  Users were forced to setup and map a dedicated Kinect Event for each Clip Launcher, which was a time-consuming and processor-intensive task if the user wished to reliably control several clips at once.  With the generation of the MPC mode provided by T3MPO, users can control the playback of twenty unique clips either individually or scenically with a single Max for Live module.  Furthermore, T3MPO’s MPC mode provides users with graphical feedback informing them and the audience of changes within the song structure or progression.

<strong>Scratcher Mode</strong>

The scratcher mode consists of a column of four square regions and a row of four square regions.  The left hand is only tracked in the column and the right hand is only tracked in the row.  The user slides his/her left hand through the different regions in the column, which changes the quantization rate of the audio clips generated by the user sliding his/her right hand through the different regions of the row producing a sound similar to that of a DJ scratching a record.  When the users right hand is within the row and the left hand is not within the column the audio clips are played without any scratcher effect.  When the user does not have his/her hands in any of the regions no audio clips are played and therefore no quantization effects take place.<br>
When there is no left hand in the column then the quantization rate is set to 1 bar meaning the full audio clip is played and starts again when it has ended as long as the right hand maintains its position in a square in the row.  The top square of the column, we will call that square 1 going down to the bottom square being 4, has a quantization rate of 1/2 bar meaning half the audio clip is played and ends at half its duration. That clip will play again after its done.  Column 2 has 1/4 bar, column 3 has 1/8 bar and column 4 has 1/16 bar.  If a different audio clip is desired to be played, it will not start until the current audio clip finishes playing at the desired quantization rate.
 
<strong>Guitar Mode</strong>

The Guitar mode allows users to play a virtual air guitar capable of generating MIDI notes.

The user can select from seven possible notes by moving their left hand along the fretboard of the virtual guitar.  The guitar defaults to selecting the first note when the user’s hand has not been detected along the fretboard.  The selected note is played when the user moves their hand up or down past a certain threshold across the strings of the guitar.  Strum arrows are drawn to the screen briefly to signify a note being played.

The T3MPO Max for Live module allows users to choose a root note and assemble a scale of notes to choose from in the Live environment.

<strong>Synapse Mode</strong>

<h4>Design Alternatives</h4>
<p>
	A design alternative to the primary requirments was to develop a standalone T3MPO application where DAW parameters such as sound toggling and playback are handled internally in a 'standalone' application.  That is, instead of using a 3rd party DAW, such as Ableton, the standalone application implements its own DAW functionality.
</p>
<h4>Preferred Implementation</h4>
<p>
	After evaluating the various possible design solutions, a two-tiered approach to implementing T3MPO was pursued. While the primary design requirements were being developed, the standalone application alternative was also being investigated and implemented.  Due to the lack of Synapse documentation, it was intimidating delving into the application's thousands of lines of perplexing source code.  Thus, the standalone application acted as a kind of fallback in the case that our team was unable to add our own T3MPO functionality atop Synapse.
