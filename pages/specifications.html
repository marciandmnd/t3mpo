<h3>V. Design Specs, Alternatives, & Implementation</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Design Requirements</h4>
<p>
T3MPO must accurately represent the playback status of the audio clips in the Ableton environment.  That is, visual feedback must be provided to the user such that they know which clips are being played and which are stopped.  Multiple buttons can be pressed simulataneously.  
</p>
<h4>Design Alternatives</h4>
<p>
	A design alternative to the primary requirments is to develop a standalone T3MPO application where DAW parameters such as sound toggling and playback are handled internally in the application.  That is, instead of using a 3rd party DAW, such as Ableton, the standalone application implements its own DAW functionality.
</p>

<h4>Preferred Implementation</h4>
<p>
	After evaluating the various possible design solutions, a two-tiered approach to implementing T3MPO was pursued. While the primary design requirements were being developed, the standalone application alternative was also being investigated and implemented.  Due to the lack of Synapse documentation, it was intimidating delving into the application's perplexing source code.  Thus, the standalone application acted as a kind of fallback in the case that our team was unable to add our own T3MPO functionality atop Synapse.
