			T3MPO is a senior engineering design project by a five member team of San Francisco State University engineering students. T3MPO is an application that explores alternative means of electronic music performance and production using 3D sensors. T3MPO users are able to control parameters of a digital audio workstation (DAW) using body movements recorded in 3-dimensional space. This feat is accomplished using the Microsoft Kinect sensor, OpenNI and openFrameworks libraries, and Ryan Challinorâ€™s application, Synapse
