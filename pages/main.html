	T3MPO is a senior engineering design project by a five member team of San Francisco State University engineering students. T3MPO is an exploration into alternative means of electronic music performance and production using 3D sensors.  Users of our system are able to control parameters of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) via body gestures in 3-dimensional space.  This feat is accomplished using the Kinect Sensor, OpenNI, and Synapse.
